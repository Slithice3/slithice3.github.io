          <p>This could either go very philosophical, or it can be really simple...Let's go with the simple way :3 </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When I was a kid, I've always been fascinated by the idea of internet...It was one of those things that really intrigues me.
		I was born in China, in a small village. Computer to me when I was young, was something that really no one can afford. Back in my day in my 
		land, we still need to dial to get internet connections. I was lucky that one of my cousin had a computer, therefore I could 
		experience internet way before any of my friends did. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Hey, did I mention I'm Ming? I'm a computer science major who likes cooking and my goal in undergraduate is to become a Vet.
		And no, becoming a vet has nothing to do with neither cooking nor computer science. </p>

        <div class="contentText">
          <p>UB, hmm. Many people came to UB for different reasons. For me, I simply like the snow here. I was born in the
		southern part of China, hence I never get to see many blizzards, or any snowflakes at all. Later I moved to New York... Beautiful city, yet
		I feel like it's missing something. Later I found out what is really missing: the isolation and freedom. Here at 
		UB, I get to sit outside and simply look at the lake, at the sky without any distractions, isn't that amazing.</p>
